# Changelog

## 0.2.13 (2026-05-06)

### Fixes
- Populate Project Spend from cached per-day project rollups so 7d/30d columns stay filled without blocking the menubar on slow historical re-parses
- Collapse `.worktrees` project paths like `exe-os-.worktrees-tom` back to their parent project names in the menubar
- Make Trend, Forecast, Stats, Project Spend, and Employee Spend respond to the selected Today/7 Days/30 Days/Month/All window instead of hardcoded day/month labels
- Default `exe-watcher optimize` to the 7-day window so the command stays interactive on larger local session corpora

### Tests
- Add TypeScript regression coverage for project-spend ranking/name cleanup
- Add Swift period-windowing tests for selected-range labels and zero-filled history windows

## 0.2.10 (2026-05-05)

### Fixes
- Resolve the menubar CLI from PATH, Homebrew, and every NVM Node bin instead of trusting only the latest NVM version or a broken PATH shim
- Keep the popover header and provider tabs locked to the selected period's all-provider payload so historical fetch failures no longer show today's provider totals beside a $0 header
- Surface human-readable CLI-not-found and timeout errors in the menubar instead of raw Swift enum dumps

### Tests
- Add Swift coverage for CLI path resolution, selected-period header consistency, historical-period error isolation, and period-to-CLI argument mapping

## 0.2.9 (2026-05-05)

### Fixes
- Match the active menubar period tab styling to the gold provider tabs, with dark purple text for contrast
- Make cold-start backfill period-aware so Today/7 Days/30 Days/Month/All fetch the history window that period needs
- Expand the menubar "All" period to a 365-day window so its totals line up with the backfill/history cap

## 0.2.8 (2026-05-05)

### Fixes
- Cold-start history now backfills at least 7 days so the default 7-day menubar view is populated immediately instead of showing only today
- Preserve the 30-day progressive catch-up limit for warm caches while allowing cold starts to parse recent historical spend

## 0.2.0 (2026-04-28)

### Features
- **AI Employees** — collapsible menubar section showing per-agent memory counts with 24h/7d/30d growth
- **Employee Spend** — model-aware cost breakdown per agent (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku rates)
- **Project Spend** — per-project cost across 24h/7d/30d periods in the menubar
- **Launch at login** — auto-registers via SMAppService Login Items (toggleable in System Settings)
- **Quit button** — clean shutdown from the menubar footer bar
- **Dynamic provider tabs** — only shows providers with actual spend data (no empty states)
- **App icon** — gold "EXE" on dark purple rounded square (Exe Foundry Bold)

### Fixes
- Eliminate battery drain from double timer, idle throttling, and QoS issues
- Use official API pricing over LiteLLM third-party markups
- Remove loading overlay — silent background refresh with pre-fetched periods for instant tab switching
- Fix double-counting in menubar JSON pipeline (cache + fresh parse overlap)

### Performance
- 7-day and 30-day queries from 2-5s down to ~1s (parse today only, daily cache for history)

## 0.1.1 (2026-04-25)

### Fixes
- Fix timezone-fragile day aggregator test (near-midnight UTC → stable midday)
- Bump version for npm publish

## 0.1.0 (2026-04-24)
